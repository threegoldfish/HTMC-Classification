This is my implementation of TaxoClass Hierarchical Multi-Label Text Classification Using Only Class Names.

In this repo, sentence-class similarity score using BART-large-MNLI instead of Roberta-Large-MNLI as originially proposed for efficiency. The results seem that on average, at least one true label (of all three) can be correctly captured.

Any feedback and discussion is welcome.
